# Review Scrapper

## Objective:

The project involves creating a web application using the Flask framework to scrape and display product reviews from the Flipkart website. Users can search for a specific product, and the application will retrieve and present the associated reviews including details like product name, rating, comment heading, and the actual comment text.

## How to use it? 

1.  Set up the python environment
2.  Install necessary packages
3.  Run app.py
4.  On the main page, input the name of the product you want to find reviews for.
5.  After submitting the search query, the application scrapes Flipkart's website to gather the reviews for the specified product. The reviews, including product 
    name, rating, comment heading, and comment text, are displayed on a separate page.
